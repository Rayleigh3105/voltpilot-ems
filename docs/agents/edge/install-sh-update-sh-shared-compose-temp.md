# install.sh / update.sh: shared compose template (lockstep chain)

Ausgelagert aus `edge-app/AGENTS.md` am 05.09.2026 (Abschnitt Nr. 2).


`update.sh` (the one-command edge updater) **sources** `install.sh` to reuse
`generate_compose()`, the `# @voltpilot-edge-install:` marker, and the shared
helpers - `install.sh` guards its `main "$@"` behind a `BASH_SOURCE` check for
exactly this, so there is ONE compose template, never a duplicated copy.
Consequences:

- `update.sh` requires `install.sh` in the same directory (script dir or CWD);
  it fails with a fetch hint otherwise.
- The lockstep chain is: repo `docker-compose.yml` -> `install.sh
  generate_compose()` (guarded by `test/install-selfcheck.sh`) -> `update.sh`
  (guarded by `test/update-selfcheck.sh`, which pins `update.sh
  --print-compose == install.sh --print-compose`).
- `update.sh` additionally embeds the **hostnet override template**
  (`generate_hostnet_compose()`), which must stay byte-identical (minus its
  marker first line) to the repo `docker-compose.hostnet.yml` -
  `test/update-selfcheck.sh` fails on drift. Changing
  `docker-compose.hostnet.yml` means updating `update.sh` too.
- Both self-checks are docker-free at their core (structural + behavioral via
  `update.sh --dry-run`, which deliberately degrades to file-only checks
  without docker); compose-config validity/equivalence run only when a modern
  `docker compose` v2 (one that understands the top-level `name:` key) is
  present.
