# Node-RED source chain: palette validation is STRUCTURAL only, trace every decision (2nd real device-down 2026-07-13)

The SAME device stayed `pending` even after the overlap fix, with NO data and
NO warn in `docker compose logs nodered`: `vp-sources-config`'s `parse()`
carried a stale communication whitelist (solarman_v5 + modbus_tcp) and
silently dropped the `fronius_sunspec` source BEFORE the flow ever saw it -
the store planned nothing, the read node idled on "keine Quellen". The e2e
tests stayed green over the bug because they injected `msg.payload` straight
into the store node, bypassing the palette parse. Rules now baked in:

- **The palette config nodes validate STRUCTURE only** (id/communication/
  family/connection.ip) - they must NEVER whitelist communication values.
  `vp-inverter-config` had the SAME stale whitelist, making the auto tab's
  fronius_solar_api/fronius_sunspec PRIMARY router branches unreachable (fixed
  alongside). Deciding readability is the flow's job: the sources store node
  logs a loud `NICHT VERDRAHTET`/`ZURUECKGESTELLT` `node.warn` per unwired
  source; the inverter router goes idle with a named status.
- **The whole chain traces unconditionally** (rate-limited 60 s per key, a
  state CHANGE always logs) via `node.log`/`node.warn`: config receipt +
  per-source routing (store), no-plans / busy-skip / read start / result /
  publish / cycle summary (read node). One `docker compose logs nodered` is
  definitive about where a source dies.
- **Every per-source read runs against a hard overall `Promise.race` cap
  (30 s)** so `src_busy_since` is always cleared - a hang ends as a logged
  Gesamt-Timeout, never a permanent silent skip.
- A faithful repro must start from the retained `edge/sources/config` BYTES
  the core's `busEntry()` publishes and run them through the REAL
  `vp-sources-config` parse (see the REGRESSION test in
  `sources-read.e2e.test.js` + the aedes-bus test in vp-palette) - injecting a
  hand-built list into the store node proves nothing about the config path.
- The vp-palette `package-lock.json` pins a corporate npm mirror; on a clean
  machine temp-rewrite it to registry.npmjs.org, `npm ci`, then
  `git checkout package-lock.json`.
